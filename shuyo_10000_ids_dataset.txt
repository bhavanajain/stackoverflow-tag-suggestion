services exactly nothing else unfortunately requires foreknowledge exactly services going maxing cpus happens unpredictable schedule never quickly.. makes things doubly difficult boss run restart start problems without thinking debug issues they're using fairly consistent amount ram (approx 60-80mb 4gb machine) good suggestions rest assured tried usual troubleshooting i'm hoping .net issue someone might know work solving boss' solution (which emphatically don't want implement) put field database holds multiple times services restart day make problem go away think i'm desperately seeking cause real problem fix solution become disaster six months @yaakov ellis different function one reads records oracle database somewhere offsite; another one processes records transfers files belonging records system; third checks files make sure they're expect be; another maintenance service constantly checks things like disk space (that enough) polls servers make sure they're alive;

i'm asking haven't done homework simple case services work anticipated that's something would caught problem time services anything yet still manage consume 25% four cpu cores they're finding work exiting loop waiting next iteration quite literally take almost cpu time here's example behaviour we're seeing service work two days (in unchanging environment) captured last week day 8am avg cpu usage approx 3% day 6pm avg cpu usage approx 8% day 7am avg cpu usage approx 20% day 11am avg cpu usage approx 30% looked possible mundane reasons i've asked question figured (rightly turns out) i'd get innovative answers (like ubiguchi's) pointers things hadn't thought (like ian's suggestion) cpu spike happen immediately preceding timer callback within timer callback immediately following timer callback misunderstand spike would problem; deal spikes it's not.. cpu usage going generally even service nothing waiting next timer hit service starts things nice calm graph looks like you'd expect.. generally 0% usage spikes 10% nhibernate hits database service trivial amount work increases across-the-board 25% (more let go far) usage times process running made ian's suggestion logical silver bullet (nhibernate lot stuff you're looking) alas i've implemented solution hasn't effect (i proof actually think it's made things worse.. average usage seeming go much faster now) note stripping nhibernate "sections" (as recommend) feasible since would strip 90% code service would let rule timer problem (which absolutely intend try) can't help rule nhibernate issue nhibernate causing dodgy fix that's implemented (see below) going become way system works; dependent nhibernate project pm simply won't accept it's causing unresolvable structural problem noted sense desperation question -- problems would continue barring small miracle don't mean come way moment services restarted daily (with option input number hours day shutdown restart) patches problem cannot long-term solution go onto production machine start become busy problems continue whether fix pm maintains constraint obviously would prefer implement real fix since initial testing revealed reason services already extensively reviewed pm would rather restart multiple times spend time trying fix that's entirely control makes miracle talking important would otherwise extremely intriguing (insofar trust profiler) don't windows services written .net 1.1 running windows machine deployed dodgy nant script using old version nhibernate database access there's little machine would actually say trust

"what potential ambiguity avoided?" rather wanted know particular choice made maybe it's performance maybe got job done considered best always allow 1-liner local override method (a pretty rare case requirement) .. i'm sort suggesting dynamical language might one postpones decision longest chooses semantics based contextual info local defined setter would use setter isn't like ruby smalltalk objc method invocation decided runtime offering maximum expressiveness
